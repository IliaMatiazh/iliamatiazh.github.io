                    I am a passionate industrial/product designer, who is dedicated to creating innovative user-centric solutions. 
                    With a combination of creativity, technical expertise, and a keen eye for aesthetics, I strive to design products 
                    that are not only functional, but also which elicit a sense of visual delight. Currently pursuing my education 
                    in industrial design at the School of Form (SWPS) in Warsaw, as a fourth (last) year student.

                        The entry for AGP contest (May, 2023) (embedded link to be sent later) for “Ducati + Starfighter + Rebel Alliance” theme. 
                        The design was chosen as one of the finalists.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is a digital project made together with my colleague, a Star Wars fan, who took the role of a star wars design language expert.

                    <p>
                        «RS-900 J-Wing» was an advanced reconnaissance starfighter. It was equipped with a complex sensor package in the rotating wing's 
                        sidepod, and four powerful engines through which it achieved remarkable speed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kuat's design philosophy seamlessly blends classic styling with a distinctive livery, paying homage to a motor icon (Ducati) from 
                        a more civilised era. This  approach did not only showcase the starfighter's aesthetic appeal but also underscored the fusion of 
                        timeless design elements with state-of-the-art technology. The «RS-900 J-Wing» was not merely a triumph of engineering; it was a 
                        testament to the seamless integration of tradition and innovation in the vast expanse of the galactic frontier.

                        The Adjustable Transformable Chair/table is designed to address the challenges of existing school furniture, particularly for middle 
                        school students aged 10-15. Recognising the lack of mobility and adjustability in current furniture, the project aims to revolutionise 
                        the traditional classroom setup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Focusing on the needs of curious and eager-to-learn students, design prioritises ergonomic comfort to enhance the learning experience. 
                        It addresses the issue of incorrectly sized furniture, which can lead to back pains and posture problems, by providing adjustable options 
                        that accommodate students' varying heights (During 5 years of studying students grow by 35-40 cm on average)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, the chair promotes natural body movement and varied postures to create a healthier and more dynamic learning environment. 
                        In addition, it emphasises flexibility and mobility, allowing for easier movement and rearrangement to adapt classrooms for different 
                        teaching styles and activities.

                    <p>
                        Speculative team project with Mikołaj Bańka, Faisal Nurrachman and Anna Fortecka in School of Form (SWPS, Warsaw)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Initial research was focused on understanding smoking habits and addressing the challenges of secondhand 
                        smoke exposure. The target group comprised aversive non-smoker university students, dealing with smokers 
                        on campus and experiencing the adverse effects of secondhand smoke. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These individuals are concerned about poor air quality caused by smoking, leading to breathing difficulties 
                        and an increased risk of respiratory problems. As a result of the research, a speculative project emerged, 
                        underlining the "conflict" between smokers and non-smokers beyond conventional cigarette pollution 
                        (air pollution).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The envisioned scenario involves a world where fine particulate pollution permeates the air, requiring 
                        personal purification devices (PPDs) in more contaminated areas. The concept of an early PPD prototype 
                        was conceived.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The PPD operates by detecting pollution through a strategically positioned dust sensor on the chest. 
                        In response to elevated pollution levels, the face shield automatically ascends to shield against smoke 
                        and fine particles. Simultaneously, an LED strip illuminates, serving as a visual indicator of potential 
                        danger not only for the user but also for those in the vicinity. Subsequently, a filtering system, 
                        discreetly located on the hip, purifies the air, ensuring the user receives a continuous supply of 
                        fresh air propelled by an integrated fan.

                    <p>
                        Team project with Anna Fortecka in collaboration with «Atypika Foundation» in School of Form (SWPS, Warsaw).

                        Top - before, bottom - after.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our team explored the significance of ensuring that entrances are accessible to all, adhering to universal 
                        design principles that promote inclusivity, including designing for neurodivergent individuals. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our observations and interviews with students, teachers and guests revealed several key findings about 
                        the main hall of the SWPS University - there is high foot traffic and activity level, information overload, 
                        high noise level and distractions, under stimulation, limited wayfinding signage (lack of clear wayfinding 
                        signage - student struggling in locating specific places within the main entrance).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, in the next stages of the project, our team designed and implemented an enhanced, organised 
                        information system, thanks to which the best possible user experience in the big (complicated) areas 
                        such as SWPS university entrance is going to be ensured.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The changes that are proposed are: placing wall with map between 2 opposite sliding doors (entrances), 
                        adding directional guiding lines on the floor, marking each part of the building with colour as well as 
                        letter (North and South wings, Parter), close CSA waiting space and create an additional room with addition 
                        of natural materials (moss, pine wood, plants), acoustic panels, more structured information and step 
                        guidance in order to get in CSA (ticket confirmation, waiting area, entrance to the CSA).
