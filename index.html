                    <p>
                        In the modern and rapidly evolving world, sustainability has a centre role, driving the development of technologies.  Among the front of this movement 
                        is the automotive industry, where electric vehicle technologies are revolutionising the automotive field by phasing out internal combustion engines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus, by understanding electric vehicles' mechanics and environmental impact, I discovered that these new technologies face public scepticism 
                        and resistance due to their unfamiliarity. This challenge is also complicated by the automotive industry's tendency to simultaneously 
                        redefine both visual and technological aspects, and, as a result, losing brands' design DNA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project aimed to reconcile the past, present, and future chain in consumers' perception. I designed an exterior car design proposal 
                        for BMW, focusing on addressing contemporary car design challenges. My goal was to blend legendary BMW's distinctive character with new 
                        technologies, bridging the gap between innovation and familiarity, and ensuring that consumers perceive a cohesive narrative that 
                        demonstrates a holistic picture of design evolution.

                        «RS-900 J-Wing» was an advanced reconnaissance starfighter. It was equipped with a complex sensor package in the rotating wing's 
                        sidepod, and four powerful engines through which it achieved remarkable speed.

                        Kuat's design philosophy seamlessly blends classic styling with a distinctive livery, paying homage to a motor icon (Ducati) from 
                        a more civilised era. This  approach did not only showcase the starfighter's aesthetic appeal but also underscored the fusion of 
                        timeless design elements with state-of-the-art technology. The «RS-900 J-Wing» was not merely a triumph of engineering; it was a 
                        testament to the seamless integration of tradition and innovation in the vast expanse of the galactic frontier.

                        The Adjustable Transformable Chair/table is designed to address the challenges of existing school furniture, particularly for middle 
                        school students aged 10-15. Recognising the lack of mobility and adjustability in current furniture, the project aims to revolutionise 
                        the traditional classroom setup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Focusing on the needs of curious and eager-to-learn students, design prioritises ergonomic comfort to enhance the learning experience. 
                        It addresses the issue of incorrectly sized furniture, which can lead to back pains and posture problems, by providing adjustable options 
                        that accommodate students' varying heights (During 5 years of studying students grow by 35-40 cm on average)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, the chair promotes natural body movement and varied postures to create a healthier and more dynamic learning environment. 
                        In addition, it emphasises flexibility and mobility, allowing for easier movement and rearrangement to adapt classrooms for different 
                        teaching styles and activities.

                    <p>
                        The initial research focused on understanding smoking habits and addressing secondhand smoke challenges 
                        among aversive non-smoker university students dealing with smokers on campus. Concerns included poor 
                        air quality, breathing difficulties, and an increased risk of respiratory problems. The research led 
                        to a speculative project highlighting the "conflict" between smokers and non-smokers, envisioning a 
                        world with pervasive fine particulate pollution. This scenario necessitated the development of 
                        personal purification devices (PPDs), and an early prototype was conceived. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The PPD operates by detecting pollution through a positioned dust sensor on the chest. In response 
                        to elevated pollution levels, the face shield automatically ascends to shield against. Simultaneously, 
                        an LED strip illuminates, serving as a visual indicator of potential danger not only for the user 
                        but also for those in the vicinity. Subsequently, a filtering system, discreetly located on the hip, 
                        purifies the air, ensuring the user receives a continuous supply of fresh air propelled by an integrated fan.

                        Supervised by the "Atypika Foundation," our team explored the importance of university entrances being 
                        universally accessible, with a focus on inclusive design principles for neurodivergent individuals. 
                        Observations and interviews at SWPS University's main hall revealed challenges like high foot traffic, 
                        information overload, noise, distractions, under-stimulation, and limited wayfinding signage. In response, 
                        our team designed and implemented an improved information system to ensure the best user experience 
                        in complex areas like the SWPS university entrance.

                        The changes that are proposed are: placing wall with map between 2 opposite sliding doors (entrances), 
                        adding directional guiding lines on the floor, marking each part of the building with colour as well 
                        as letter (North and South wings, Parter), close CSA waiting space and create an additional room with 
                        addition of natural materials (moss, pine wood, plants), acoustic panels, more structured information 
                        and step guidance in order to get in CSA (ticket confirmation, waiting area, entrance to the CSA).
